<h1>astonstreet.com - Theme Obscene - 19 October 2004 </h1>
<p>This theme is provided free of charge with absolutely no garauntee or warranty implied. You should test theme for suitability to your needs before using. I make themes as a hobby and I only hope that in doing so I am helping out others. All positive or negative feedback, comments or advice is welcome. I can be contacted through my site <a href="http://astonstreet.com">http://astonstreet.com</a> or by <a href="mailto:paul@astonstreet.com">email paul@astonstreet.com</a>.</p>
<h1>Notes on this theme:</h1>
<ul>
  <li>I have tested this theme in the following browsers: IE 5.1, 5.5 and 6, FireFox 0.93, Opera 7.54 &amp; Mozilla 0.73.~ IE5 throws a little bit of the &quot;overlap&quot; bug but Its not enough of an issue for me personaly to worry doing anything about, perhaps you feel differently. As always you should test a theme yourself in various browsers before using. The theme is pretty much uniform across ie6, Mozilla, Firefox and Opera. I havent access to a MAC or linux system so I can only assume that theme works ok under these platforms. </li>
  <li>Theme validates xhtml 1.0 and CSS, it seems a lot of people care greatly about this these days and I guess thats a good thing.</li>
  <li>The top navbar rollover doesnt work great in IE but still does the job. I wish everybody used Mozilla!!</li>
  <li>I assume that most people will be able to modify the links in the top nav bar and the Logo etc to their liking. If you dont know  any html or arent sure how to do this then drop me a line and provided I have time I will help ya out. </li>
  <li>Theme has a &quot;Theme by Astonstreet&quot; link near footer of page, I would appreciatte this being left there but I dont demand it.</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>
<h1>Important: </h1>
<p>When you upload the theme, make sure you upload the right folder!!. In the zipping process another folder is usualy created, this means that after unzipping, the actual Theme folder may be inside another folder. The correct folder to upload is the folder that contains the &quot;theme.html&quot; file. </p>
